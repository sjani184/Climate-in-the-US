## Conclusions
As awareness of climate change continues to climb in the United States, more and more people and industries are turning to renewable energy. These renewable resources ultimately do not produce carbon emissions leading to cleaner and more efficient energy sources. Our models predict that renewable energy will continue to increase in the United States, potentially replacing non-renewable energy as our main energy provider. Sales of Eletric Vehicles (EV) will also continue to increase as these cars become cheaper and more accessible.
